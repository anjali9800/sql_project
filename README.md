# sql_project
This SQL project is based on a Pizza Sales dataset. It includes creation of relational tables (pizzas, pizza_type, orders, and order_details), data importing using BULK INSERT, and running various queries to extract insights such as pizza prices, types, sizes, and order quantities. The project was developed using Microsoft SQL Server.
